# PokéTom
An original Pokémon game written in a custom 2D engine, using SFML 3+ purely for rendering code as I am not a graphics programmer. The engine features are being developed as the game gets made.

I want this to be a long-term side project to practise using modern C++ features in a game development context.
## Planned Features
1. KMB + Gamepad support
2. Sprite animation system
3. Sprite tile system, efficient loading exported levels from Tiled with ZLib
4. Embdedded gameplay scripting system
5. Dialogue and localisation systems
6. Pokemon game mechanics
a. Battling with NPCs
b. Catching wild pokemon
c. Monster stats
d. Type matchups and abilities
7. Audio system with support for sound effects and music playback
